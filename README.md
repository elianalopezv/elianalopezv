And welcome to my GH profile :v:

### What I do <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/iDaCeaKrHhUI1I8e2b/giphy.gif" width="30px" height="30px">
Iâ€™m a full-stack developer experienced in React, Go, Python, and Java. Currently expanding into DevOps, focusing on CI/CD pipelines, AWS, infrastructure as code, and system monitoring :octopus:
<br />
I enjoy being versatile and picking up new skills! :rocket:

### What I want to learn <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/BjWcUDr45IVL4lqVvq/giphy.gif" width="30px" height="30px">
I want to grow my DevOps skills and dive into SRE principles for better system performance and reliability :wrench:
<br />
Iâ€™d like to continue working on improving developers' experience to speed up feature shipping :speedboat:
<br />
And I'd love to start contributing to open source :penguin:
