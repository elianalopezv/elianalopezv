### Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2t9xWdjuhTpa99pLma/giphy.gif" width="30px">
And welcome to my GH profile :v:

### What I do <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/iDaCeaKrHhUI1I8e2b/giphy.gif" width="30px">
I work mainly on developing web applications with React.js.
<br />
Also, I work doing backend when it's needed. I've worked with Python, Java, and Go.
<br />
I don't limit myself to a single tool or language, so I try to learn a bit of everything I need on the way! :rocket:

### What I want to learn <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/BjWcUDr45IVL4lqVvq/giphy.gif" width="30px">
I'm currently curious about UI Design, animations, and how to create cool stuff with CSS :nail_care:
<br />
I'm also interested in increasing my DevOps knowledge :whale:
<br />
And I'd love to start contributing to open source :penguin:

### Fun fact&nbsp; <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/tIH62bvDMxxncCsV9J/giphy.gif" width="24px">
My first job was developing videogames! :space_invader:
