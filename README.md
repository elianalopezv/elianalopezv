### Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2t9xWdjuhTpa99pLma/giphy.gif" width="30px" height="30px">
And welcome to my GH profile :v:

### What I do <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/iDaCeaKrHhUI1I8e2b/giphy.gif" width="30px" height="30px">
I do full stack web development. I've worked mainly with React, Java, Python and Go.
<br />
I enjoy picking up new skills and can quickly adapt to new technologies. This has allowed me to gain experience in multiple languages and tools! :rocket:

### What I want to learn <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/BjWcUDr45IVL4lqVvq/giphy.gif" width="30px" height="30px">
I'm currently focused on growing my DevOps skills :whale:
<br />
I'm also curious about UI Design and how to create cool stuff with CSS :nail_care:
<br />
And I'd love to start contributing to open source :penguin:
